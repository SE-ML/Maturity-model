# A machine learning maturity model for teams

This repository comprises an interactive Excel workbook that serves as the implementation of a machine learning (ML) maturity model for teams. The interactive workbook aims to assists teams in 
assessing their development processes, obtaining their maturity results and planning the improvement of their processes.

The maturity model is created as part of a masterâ€™s thesis in the programme ICT in Business and the Public Sector at the Leiden University. The model consists of 45 ML engineering best practices of 
the [SE4ML catalogue](https://se-ml.github.io/practices/). These practices are arranged into two representations (i.e. views): the domain and maturity representation. The domain representation 
describes the maturity of a team regarding particular domains (e.g. training, coding and deployment) measured by by engineering capability (EC) levels. The maturity representation focsuses on the 
maturity of the overall development process of a team measured by maturity levels. The model defines 4 EC levels and 6 maturity levels.
